GC/Wii DSP plugin for IDA
=========================

This project adds support for the DSP present in the Gamecube and the
Wii to IDA, the Interactive Disassembler [1]. This allows easy analyze
of a DSP ucode, handling cross-references, control flow, and so on.

Requirements
------------

* Python >= 2.6
* IDA >= 6.1 (other versions may work, not tested)
* IDAPython >= 1.5.2 (same as IDA, other versions not tested)

How to install?
---------------

Copy gcdsp.py and gcdsp_generated.py to the "procs/" directory under IDA
root. If installation worked correctly, you should be able to choose
"GC/Wii DSP: gcdsp" as the CPU type when opening a new file.
